# React + Jest + Testing library tests

This react application is a small demo of how to write very simple tests

lookout for `src/components/ReportComponent/__test__/ReportComponent.test.tsx` file

I have opted to go with TypeScript here instead of plain JavaScript(this can totally be done in JS as well) because interfaces makes my job very easy to test props and prevents accidentals errors + getting very good intellisense as a bonus
